We currently use [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) for managing global state. Reflux is a simple library for unidirectional dataflow architecture inspired by ReactJS [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html).

# Overview

The main function of Reflux is to introduce a more functional programming style architecture by adopting a single data flow pattern.

```
+---------+       +--------+       +-----------------+
¦ Actions ¦------>¦ Stores ¦------>¦ View Components ¦
+---------+       +--------+       +-----------------+
     ^                                      ¦
     +--------------------------------------+
```

In this pattern, actions initiate the process of data passing through data stores before returning to the view components. A view component's event that requires changes to the application's data stores signals the stores with the available actions.

We will use `PageFilters`[<sup id="1HGoLB">↓</sup>](#f-1HGoLB) for our example.

For usage, you need to create actions that can be called from React components. Those actions are listened to by stores which hold and update data. In turn those stores are hooked up to React components and set state within them as it is updated within the store.

So there are three parts:

# 1\. Creating Actions

An action is a [function object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object) that can be invoked like any other function.

Actions are registered under `📄 static/app/actions` , e.g., `PageFiltersActions`[<sup id="Z2wU2DS">↓</sup>](#f-Z2wU2DS) are registered in `📄 static/app/actions/pageFiltersActions.tsx`

<br/>

To create actions we use `createActions`[<sup id="1Hy98y">↓</sup>](#f-1Hy98y) , like so:
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 static/app/actions/pageFiltersActions.tsx
```tsx
⬜ 1      import {createActions} from 'reflux';
⬜ 2      
🟩 3      const PageFiltersActions = createActions([
🟩 4        'reset',
🟩 5        'initializeUrlState',
🟩 6        'updateProjects',
🟩 7        'updateDateTime',
🟩 8        'updateEnvironments',
🟩 9        'updateDesyncedFilters',
🟩 10       'pin',
🟩 11     ]);
⬜ 12     
⬜ 13     export default PageFiltersActions;
⬜ 14     
```

<br/>

## More on Actions

Actions can also:

*   load files asynchronously with child actions
    
*   do preEmit and shouldEmit checking
    
*   have many shortcuts for easy usage
    

See [Reflux Action Documentation](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs/blob/master/docs/actions) for more.

<br/>

# 2\. Creating a Store

Stores are registered under `📄 static/app/stores` , e.g., `📄 static/app/stores/pageFiltersStore.tsx` .

Create a data store much like ReactJS's own `React.Component` .

<br/>

The store has a `State`[<sup id="Z1cSjpV">↓</sup>](#f-Z1cSjpV) property much like a component.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 static/app/stores/pageFiltersStore.tsx
```tsx
⬜ 9      
⬜ 10     import {CommonStoreDefinition} from './types';
⬜ 11     
🟩 12     type State = {
🟩 13       desyncedFilters: Set<PinnedPageFilter>;
🟩 14       isReady: boolean;
🟩 15       pinnedFilters: Set<PinnedPageFilter>;
🟩 16       selection: PageFilters;
🟩 17     };
⬜ 18     
⬜ 19     type InternalDefinition = {
⬜ 20       /**
```

<br/>

You may set up all action listeners in the `init`[<sup id="Zg8NuN">↓</sup>](#f-Zg8NuN) method, and register them by calling the store's own `listenTo`[<sup id="ZKp0og">↓</sup>](#f-ZKp0og) function.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 static/app/stores/pageFiltersStore.tsx
```tsx
⬜ 57       hasInitialState: false,
⬜ 58       unsubscribeListeners: [],
⬜ 59     
🟩 60       init() {
🟩 61         this.reset(this.selection);
🟩 62     
🟩 63         this.unsubscribeListeners.push(this.listenTo(PageFiltersActions.reset, this.onReset));
⬜ 64         this.unsubscribeListeners.push(
⬜ 65           this.listenTo(PageFiltersActions.initializeUrlState, this.onInitializeUrlState)
⬜ 66         );
```

<br/>

#### **More on Stores:**

Reflux stores are very powerful. They can even do things like contribute to a global state that can be read and set for partial or full-state time-travel, debugging, etc.

See [Reflux Store Documentation](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs/blob/master/docs/stores) to learn more about stores.

<br/>

# 3\. Dispatch Actions using Action Creators

We use action creator functions (under `📄 static/app/actionCreators` ) to dispatch actions.

<br/>

For example:
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 static/app/actionCreators/pageFilters.tsx
```tsx
⬜ 91     /**
⬜ 92      * Reset values in the page filters store
⬜ 93      */
🟩 94     export function resetPageFilters() {
🟩 95       PageFiltersActions.reset();
🟩 96     }
```

<br/>

For usage, you need to create actions which can be called from React components. Those actions are listened to by stores which hold and update data. In turn those stores are hooked up to React components and set state within them as it is updated within the store.
